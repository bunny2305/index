    ðŸŒ¸ To the kindest soul I've met so far, ðŸŒ¸

I wanted to let you know how much I appreciate you, even though we spent just one day together. That day meant a lot to me, and I can't help but think about it. It was the first time I felt so good spending time. You made me feel at ease, like I was at home and safe. Sure, I might have messed up a bit that day, but let me tell you, you're unlike anyone I've ever met.

That hug you gave me changed something in me. I couldn't sleep that whole night; all I could do was think about you. I stayed awake looking out for you, and honestly, it was worth it. Just seeing you made me happy. I'm not saying this just now; even after two days, it's true.

I know you might be thinking that I say these things to every girl, but that's not the case. I've only written a letter like this for one person, and that's you. You're way more special than anyone else. 

In the end, I just want you to know that you made me feel comfortable and happy. I might not be around for long, but I promise that for the time I'm here, I'll treat you like a princess every day.

Sincerely,
TEDDY ðŸ’–
